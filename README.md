# Welcome to Your First Registration Form!

This is a simple webpage that lets people sign up or register. It's like a signup sheet on the internet!

## What's in it?
- A form where people can write their first name, last name, email address, and choose a password.
- It makes sure that all the places are filled in before letting someone submit their information.

## How to Make It Work?
1. **Put the Code in Your Project**: Copy this whole text and save it in a file ending with `.html` (for example, `signup.html`). This is your webpage!
2. **Tell It Where to Send Info**: Find the line that starts with `<form action=`. You'll need to replace `/submit-your-form-endpoint` with a special link given by a grown-up or teacher that knows where to send the information safely.
3. **Make It Pretty**: There's a line near the top that mentions `style.css`. This is a styling file that makes your form look nice. You can either create your own `style.css` file or ask for help to make your webpage look cooler!

## Testing It Out
Once you've got your `.html` file, you can open it in any web browser to see your form. Try filling it out! If you've set up where to send the information, you can even try submitting it.

Remember, making websites is a bit like magic â€“ it takes practice but you can create amazing things. Have fun!
